# Slack Bot

This is a basic bot structure project. You need an API token from Slack
to connect to Slack services. You need to have an account. If you don't have one,
create one (It is free). Follow the links contained on this documentation to get started.

To create an app: https://api.slack.com/apps

After creating your app, you will see your app listed on the apps section. Just click on the
app name to get to the configuration page. There you can get the token needed for your bot to 
communicate with the Slack platform. 

## Steps to run project 

First off, you need to have installed NodeJS on your machine. You can get it from here:
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.13.1/ . The installation process is different for 
the available OS (Linux, MacOS, Windows). Follow the corresponding steps to install it.

After NodeJS is installed on your computer, open the project on your favorite IDE or code editor.
Run from your shell prompt the following command: *npm install*. This will install the corresponding packages
and dependencies.

To run your app, execute this command: *nodemon app*. That's it, now you have the app up and running to test locally.
Follow the instructions on the source code to add your Slack token.
