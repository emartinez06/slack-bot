# Slack Bot

This is a basic bot structure project. You need an APi token from Slack
to connect to Slack services. You need to have an account. If you don't have one,
create one (It is free). Follow the links contained on this documentation to get started.

To create an app: https://api.slack.com/apps

After creating your app, you will see your app listed on the apps section. Just click on the
app name to get to the configuration page. There you can get the token needed for your bot to 
communicate with the Slack platform.
